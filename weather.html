            <h2>Peer Review</h2>
            <p>Dustin Rowbury reviewed my webpage and suggested that I increase the white space on my large screen view. He said it would be good to shrink the size of the precipitation, wind speed and direction sections and consequently add more space between that information and the short term forecast. I agreed with Dustin that more white space on the large screen view would allow for more breathability and convenience for the user. Therefore, I adjusted my sketch to the one seen above.</p>
